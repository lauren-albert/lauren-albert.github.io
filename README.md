## About Me
Hi all, my name is Lauren.  I recently graduated from the University of Connecticut with a B.S. in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology (EEB). My passions focus on all things parasite. I am mostly interested in disease ecology and hope to pursue projects that look at enviornmental impacts on a parasites' role within the community.  As a student, I joined Dr. Sarah Knutie's lab in the EEB Department.  You can read more about my research in this lab here.
